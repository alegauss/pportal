"""Vendor the roadkeep engine into ``.roadkeep/``, the way ``npm install`` fills ``node_modules``.

Why the engine lives in the repository
--------------------------------------
roadkeep owns this project's ROADMAP / CHANGELOG / IMPROVEMENTS / DEFERRED, so a session runs it
constantly.
Running it from wherever it happens to be found costs two things every day:

* **Every distinct command path is a fresh authorization prompt.** A copy under a plugin cache or
  a scratch directory changes path per version and per machine, so the allowance never sticks.
  ``.roadkeep/scripts/roadkeep.py`` is one stable path, allow-listed once in
  ``.claude/settings.json``.
* **Which copy answers is not decidable by looking.** A machine can carry several plugin caches at
  different versions across two config directories, and a live checkout can be mid-refactor — a
  session lost time to ``ImportError: cannot import name '_print_claim'`` out of a half-edited tree.

``ROADKEEP_HOME`` points here (``.claude/settings.json``), which is the launcher's own first
resolution step, so the guard hook, the MCP server and a hand-run command all reach one engine.
``.roadkeep/`` is git-ignored: reproduced by this script, never committed.

Written in Python rather than Node deliberately: roadkeep *is* Python, so the interpreter this needs
is the one the thing being installed already requires — ``.claude/settings.json`` already runs its
guard hook as ``python ...``. A Node implementation would add a dependency that a C++/Qt repository
has no other reason to carry.

The source is chosen by **version**, never by position — candidates are asked ``--version`` and the
highest wins. Set ``ROADKEEP_SRC`` to force one.

Usage::

    python scripts/install_roadkeep.py            vendor the newest engine found
    python scripts/install_roadkeep.py --check    report only; exit 1 when out of date
