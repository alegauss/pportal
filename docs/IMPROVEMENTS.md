# Improvements

## Block A — Core

## Block B — Native interop

### §PP93 Three answers to one question

This client carries three different touchpad extents. streamsession.cpp picks per
console - 1920x942 for a PS4, 1919x1079 for a PS5 - which are the real dimensions of a
DualShock 4 and a DualSense pad. controllermanager.h defines PS_TOUCHPAD_MAXX 1920 and
PS_TOUCHPAD_MAXY 1079, which is each axis's larger value and therefore neither pad, and
the dpad-touch path and the SDL touchpad path both use it whichever console is
connected.

On a PS4, holding dpad-down walks the finger to y=1079 on a pad that ends at 942, and
dpad-right reaches x=1920 on a PS5 pad that ends at 1919. The error is always outward,
so the gesture keeps working and stops near the edge rather than at it.

Whether that is worth changing is genuinely open, which is why this is an idea and not a
task. The console may well clamp what it is sent, in which case the only cost is that
the last increment of travel does nothing. Nobody has measured it, and measuring it
needs a PS4 as well as a PS5.

What is not open is that one client should not hold three answers to one question.
Whatever the right pair is, the dpad path and the mouse path should read it from the
same place - and the reason to write that down now is that the port has just copied all
three, so it is the moment when the duplication is visible.

## Block C — Video and input path

## Block D — Screens

## Block E — Windows-only build

### §PP63 One configure that exists only to be measured

PP62 measured why. MSYS2 MinGW64 ships no qt6-webengine, and the published Windows
releases are MSYS2 builds carrying no Chromium either - v1.10.0's x64 portable is 261.5
MB with no QtWebEngineCore, no icudtl.dat and no .pak. So the before is not something to
download. It has to be built, and MinGW cannot: Chromium on Windows needs MSVC or
clang-cl.

What this is: a second configure, MSVC or clang-cl, building the Qt client with
CHIAKI_HAVE_WEBENGINE defined, once, so measure-startup has a binary to point at. What
it is not: a second build system. compile.cmd stays the tree's only build and the only
gate for a deletion.

Neither half of that toolchain is here, measured 2026-08-16: no cl.exe, no clang-cl, no
LLVM, no Qt under any usual root, and a Visual Studio Installer with no product behind
it. So this line starts with two multi-gigabyte installs - Build Tools with the C++
workload, and Qt for msvc2022_64 carrying QtWebEngine from an installer wanting an
account. That is a decision about the machine rather than a step of the port, and is why
this is open.

The risk a second toolchain brings is that somebody uses it for ordinary work, the build
splits in two, and the port keeps both green for ever. So the constraint is part of the
task: it stays outside compile.cmd's preflight and gates no commit.

The assertion is measure-startup's exit code - 0 rather than 2, which it returns only
where it found Chromium in the tree it measured.

### §PP301 The first green run

PP22 put the native build on a runner and configured it the only way a runner can be
configured - MSVC with the vcpkg toolchain - and that toolchain has never compiled a
line of this tree. Everything anyone here has ever built came through MSYS2 MinGW64, so
the workflow's first push is also the first test of it.

What is likely to be found there, named rather than discovered one red push at a time:
lib/ and third-party/ carry GCC's picky warning set and `-Werror-implicit-function-
declaration`, which cl.exe does not accept; the vendored curl configures itself off the
compiler it detects; nanopb's generator wants a Python 3 that vcpkg does not install;
and libplacebo is found through pkgconf, which vcpkg lays down as a tool rather than on
PATH.

The assertions PP22 shipped cover the file - every path it names, the framework it
installs, the toolchain it configures through - and cover nothing about whether the
build succeeds. That is the honest boundary: only a runner answers that, and pretending
otherwise would put a second build system in a test.

So this is the first green run, and what it costs is whatever the four above turn out to
be. It is filed apart from PP22 because the workflow is worth having while it is red -
the alternative was leaving CI unwritten until someone had a runner to iterate against,
which is how a port keeps building on exactly one machine.

### §PP302 The third verb in PP22's sentence

PP22's line named three things CI had stopped doing - builds, signs, packages - and
shipped two of them. The third is here because it is not the same kind of work: the
other two were files to write, and this one starts with buying something.

What an unsigned Windows application costs its user is concrete rather than theoretical.
SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC" on first run of an executable with no
reputation, and the button that runs it anyway is behind "More info". Browsers warn on
the download. The installer PP274 compiles carries the same absence, so the warning is
the first thing a new user sees and the last thing they see before deciding this is not
worth it.

The certificate is the decision. An OV certificate is issued to a name and can be used
from a runner with the key in a secret; an EV one carries reputation from the day it is
issued and lives on hardware, which a hosted runner cannot reach without a signing
service. Azure Trusted Signing sits between the two and is a subscription. All three are
a purchase and an identity check against a legal entity, and none of them is a step this
port can take on its own.

Filed so the gap is written down rather than remembered. The workflow signs nothing
today and says nothing about it, which is the state where a release goes out unsigned
because every part of it was green.

## Block F — Managed core

### §PP27 The transport, and the only place GC is a real question

takion.c is 2007 lines plus takionsendbuffer.c at 277 and reorderqueue.c at 200: the
sequencing, the retransmission, the send window and the reordering a video stream over
UDP needs.

This is the one task in the block where the runtime is a genuine risk rather than a
prejudice. A pause at the wrong moment is a dropped frame, and the traffic is thousands
of small packets a second, each an allocation if written carelessly. .NET has the answer
- Span, ArrayPool, SocketAsyncEventArgs - chosen deliberately.

THE MAC GATE IS ANSWERED. PP610 took PP531's measurement over 4025 heads a PS5 sent:
0.18us managed against 0.08us for the C, inside a 1159us mean gap. Under a fiftieth of a
percent, and the ratio is what a second machine keeps.

THE LOOP AROUND IT IS REACHABLE NOW, which this used to say it was not. Every receive
handler is file-local and removing a `static` is the patch a non-goal refuses, so PP601
named the door: chiaki_takion_connect takes the caller's socket. PP602 found the far end
must answer rather than replay, the tag being drawn fresh inside connect; PP606 built
that peer and PP607 runs a real takion against it, to the connected event.

WHAT IS LEFT IS WHAT TO FEED IT. PP510 keeps eighteen bytes a datagram on purpose -
enough for the dispatch and the MAC layout, and no frame of anybody's screen. Timing the
whole loop wants payloads, so it wants a second decision about what to record rather
than more code.

### §PP30 Reed-Solomon, by hand

third-party/jerasure and third-party/gf-complete implement erasure coding over GF(2^8),
and frameprocessor.c is what calls them: when packets of a video frame are missing, the
FEC blocks are what reconstruct them instead of asking for a retransmission that would
arrive too late to matter.

The surface to port is the call sites rather than the vendored source, so that is what
is declared here, where `remaining PP30` reads 13, across common.c, fec.c and
frameprocessor.c.

```roadkeep-remaining
lib/src/**/*.c :: jerasure|galois_
```

There is no NuGet package that is a drop-in for this, so it is the one dependency in the
block that has to be written rather than referenced. The arithmetic is well understood
and the code is small; what it is not is forgiving - a table built wrong produces frames
that decode into garbage only when packets are actually lost, which is to say only on a
network nobody is testing on.

Two mitigations, both cheap. The tables and the recovery have fixed inputs, so the
oracle covers them completely offline. And keeping the C for this one piece is a
legitimate outcome, because it is self-contained, has no OS surface, and is called with
buffers rather than with state.

### §PP107 The two that were said to be uncalled

chiaki_reorder_queue_drop and chiaki_reorder_queue_peek are both broken. PP562: the
suite calls both and pins the drop, contrary to this.

drop announces the element to the drop callback and then does not remove it. It never
clears entry->set, so the element stays peekable and pullable - and its own
count-reduction loop, `while(!entry->set)`, cannot run for the same reason. peek writes
through its seq_num pointer unconditionally, and takion.c passes NULL for it. Read, not
run: running it is the crash.

Both are on one path: when crypt becomes available, takion re-checks the MACs of
everything already queued and drops what fails. There, peek cannot survive a set entry,
and a rejected packet is delivered anyway. The path needs a non-empty data queue when
crypt initialises, which is presumably why it has survived.

Decided: accepted. Not patched, because every drift check in this port asserts that the
managed side matches lib/, and a local patch would leave them asserting agreement with a
libchiaki nobody else runs. Reporting upstream stays open and is not this project's to
send.

What that cost was a reason held in prose, and prose does not go red. So
ReorderQueueSource holds five facts about the two and their caller: drop clears no set
flag, its count loop is guarded by the return above it, peek writes both out-pointers
where pull guards its own, and takion still passes NULL and still drops on a bad MAC.
Repair any upstream and the port's copy becomes the divergence, on the next run.

### §PP773 The signal only tests raise

PP772's ladder named it. A live run reaches CongestionStarted and stops in the wait
after it - the takion connect state - and that wait ends on a flag the host raises
through Signal. Nothing in app calls Signal. The only callers are doubles.

WHICH MAKES EVERY WAIT IN THE RUN A TIMEOUT. There are three: the takion connect state,
the bang, and the streaminfo. Each waits on the same flags and each would end the same
way, so this is not one rung failing but the first of three that cannot pass.

THE C RAISES THEM FROM ITS HANDLERS. takion's connected event sets state_finished and
signals; the bang handler does the same; so does the streaminfo. PP721 and PP729 ported
the handlers' DECISIONS - what a bang means, which flag a refusal leaves alone - and
PP745 built the host that holds the flags. What was never written is the wire between
them: the arrivals reach the dispatch and the dispatch tells nobody.

SO THE SEAM IS THE ONE PP741 COUNTS. The host's Signal is a member with no caller
outside a test, which is the shape that census was written for - and it did not report
it, because the host is a class and the member exists. A seam is not only an interface
with no implementor; it is also a method only doubles call.</section_body> </invoke>

## Block G — Test discipline

## Block H — Performance and telemetry

### §PP46 Two numbers that are easy and get assumed

QtWebEngine is in the build for one login screen and WebView2 replaces it with a control
the operating system already carries. The expected result is a smaller installer and a
faster cold start, and both are trivially measurable and routinely asserted without
being.

Cold start to the console list, installer size, and process working set at idle.
Recorded on the Qt build alongside the rest of the baseline, then again after, in the
same record the sink already writes.

Small task, and it is here because these are the two numbers most likely to be quoted in
a release note. A quoted number that nobody measured is the kind of claim that survives
long past the day it stopped being true.

### §PP55 The instrument outside the process

PP40 shipped the half that a regression test can use: input queueing, the console's
reported round trip and the decode-to-present handoff, summed into a floor. What it
cannot do is say whether that floor tracks the real click-to-photon delay, because every
term it is missing - the console's input handling, the game's render, the encoder, the
display's own pipeline - lives outside this process.

Reflex Latency Analyzer measures click to photon on a monitor that supports it, without
a camera rig. It does not apply to this client as a low latency mode: Reflex controls a
render queue this application does not have. As a measuring device it answers exactly
the question, and it is the reason this line is filed rather than folded into PP40.

The hardware is what blocks it: the development machine has an NVIDIA card but no
Reflex-capable monitor, so no number can be taken today. Taken later against a converted
tree, it measures the port instead of the client - the same window that closes on PP39
closes on this.

### §PP303 Whether PP46 still earns PP63

PP46 was filed when this port read as chiaki-ng continued by other means: same name,
same version, the next thing a user of it would install. Under that reading, "dropping
the bundled browser makes startup and the installer smaller" is a claim about an
upgrade, and measuring it against the build being replaced is the only honest way to
state it.

That reading was settled against on 2026-08-22, in PP277: this is a new application
rather than upstream's next version, it inherits nothing from an installed one, and its
installer now says so with an identity of its own. A delta measured against a Qt build
is then a comparison between two products, which is a different sentence and a weaker
one.

What it costs to keep is not small. PP63 is what produces the before, and PP63 is two
multi-gigabyte installs - Build Tools with the C++ workload, and Qt for msvc2022_64
carrying QtWebEngine from an account-gated installer - plus a second toolchain that the
task itself argues has to be kept away from ordinary work.

So the question is whether PP46 still earns PP63, and there are three answers. Keep
both. Re-base PP46 on this application alone - cold start and installer size as a budget
with a ceiling, needing no Qt at all. Or retire both, and let the browser this port does
not bundle be a fact rather than a measurement. What a number is for is the author's
call.

## Block I — NVIDIA path

### §PP47 The right NVIDIA feature, waiting on a switch

The shipped half: DLSS cannot apply here, RTX Video Super Resolution is the candidate,
and the floor is measured. The plain upscale from 1080p NV12 to 4K costs 262.9us mean
and 274.1us p99 on the RTX 4060 - 1.6% of a frame at 60fps. Whatever VSR costs, it costs
that plus something.

What is left is VSR's own number. The spike in spike/video-upscale sets the stream
extension and nothing changes: 0 of 8.3 million pixels differ, while nvsvsr.dll and
nvvitvsr.dll sit in the driver store, so the feature is installed and unreached.

Three candidates were filed and two are now dropped. The GUID is mpv's, corroborated
across three independent retrievals. Offscreen output is not disqualifying: mpv's own
filter writes to an ordinary texture and works.

What survives is the driver's own switch, and mpv documents it: the option "only enables
the appropriate processing extensions; whether it actually works depends on your
hardware and the settings in your GPU driver's control panel". The remaining step is a
human one: NVIDIA Control Panel, Video, RTX Video Enhancement, then re-run.

That is a finding rather than a defect, and it belongs to PP51 as much as here: a vendor
path needing a control panel visit has a different contract from one that does not, and
a user who never opens that panel gets the unaccelerated path silently.

The quality half stays unanswerable here regardless. It needs a real decoded frame,
which needs a console, so the synthetic pattern settles cost and never benefit.

### §PP49 HDR on a stream that does not carry it

The window already deals with HDR when the stream is HDR. The case this covers is the
other one: an SDR stream on a display capable of more, which is most sessions on most
titles.

The cost half is done and it came back cheap. RTX Video HDR engages on this card and
costs 29.0us a frame, 0.17% of a 60fps interval - see spike/video-hdr, and the ledger
for the number. So cost is not what decides this feature, which is worth saying because
it is the question this line was filed to answer.

A sentence that stood here is now false, and its correction is why the spike was written
carefully. This said RTX Video HDR "runs on the same NGX surface as the upscaler". It
does not: super resolution is the NVIDIA PPE interface at method 2 and true HDR is an
interface of its own at method 3, so a spike inheriting PP47's constant would have set
an extension the driver knows, been accepted, and reported PP47's finding as news.

What is left is the half a number cannot reach. An inferred HDR image is an opinion
about colour the source did not express, and on some content it looks worse - so the
picture has to be judged on a decoded console frame rather than on the synthetic chart
the cost was taken from, and whatever ships is a setting that turns off with a fidelity
mode bypassing it. Both are criteria on the line now.

### §PP53 The one that removes waiting instead of adding work

Nothing in the window mentions VRR, G-SYNC or adaptive sync. Frames from a console
arrive when the network delivers them - irregularly by nature - and a fixed refresh
present rounds every one of them up to the next vblank. At 60Hz that is up to 16ms of
pure waiting, added to a frame that already travelled a network.

Variable refresh is the direct answer, and it is the only item in this block that makes
the picture arrive earlier rather than look better or arrive smoother.

The first thing measured was whether PP319's choice had already cost it. It has not, at
either depth. DXGI takes DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_ALLOW_TEARING on a composition swapchain
and presents with it, and PP646 asked again through a committed tree - the swapchain as
a visual's content on a real window - where it survives too. Both refuse that present
where the flag was not asked for, so the flags are read. A sentence here is corrected by
that: it said exclusive fullscreen is the usual precondition, and the tearing pair is
what replaced needing one.

What is left is the half an API cannot answer. A composed frame goes through DWM, so a
flag DXGI accepted is not a panel that followed - which is the mistake PP163 made one
subsystem along, and there is no display here that varies its refresh to check it on.
Below the display's minimum, low framerate compensation changes the behaviour again, and
that too is read rather than assumed.

## Block J — Public documentation
